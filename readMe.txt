this is my take and a practice on a factorial calculator
utilizing event listeners, conditions, and operators

i am now taking notes for each function and what i learned
regarding these notes
i have come to terms that each language is different
and i will only progress if i make notes
so if ever i forget these concepts or syntax someday
i have this to lookback on

with practice, this can be muscle memory

note:

always remember to use:
html:5
to construct initial boilerplate
